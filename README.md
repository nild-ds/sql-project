# Overview
The Pizza Sales Project is a data analysis project aimed at analyzing and extract sales data from a pizza restaurant chain. This project utilizes SQL for data extraction. The goal of this project is to provide insights and actionable information to help the pizza restaurant chain optimize its operations, improve sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.

SQL is used to transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. This involve tasks such as joining tables and modifying the table by providing new column names to create a match between the tables.

# 3. Data Analysis
Once the data is prepared, various SQL queries are written to perform in-depth data analysis. This include:


-Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
-Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
-Identify the highest-priced pizza.
-Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
-List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
-Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
-Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.

-Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
-Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
-Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
